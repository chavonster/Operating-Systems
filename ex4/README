REMARKS: 

In this exercise we had to implement a cache system for a file system.
The idea was to superimpose to cache on the RAM and so avoid redundant disk
accesses. We had to implement three different cache algorithms whereas 
each has a different policy for removing blocks from the cache once it is full.
Thus, we used an OO design for the cache implementation. Each cache algorithm
inherits from the cache interface and overrides the removal policy based
on the algorithm itself. This seemed like the natural design decision since
the objects have a is-a relationship. For the blocks themselves we figured
that a block object is optimal. In the library directory we have used 
polymorphism approach.
